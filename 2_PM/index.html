                    I decided to make everything from scratch and used nothing from previous projects or bootstrap or other libraries
                    to have some practice with HTML/CSS before hitting React (tomorrow?).

                    the huge number of Latin tables I committed to memory when I studied it; the second is some images of some work I've done in Blender as a hobby recenetly to handle the image 
                    requirement; the fourth is UNDECIDED as of yet!
