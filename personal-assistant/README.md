# Personal Assistant Web App

Over the next few days we'll be learning all about React. To apply what we'll 
learn, you're going to build a Personal Assistant to help manage your TODOs.

To run the App, just type `npm run dev` into the terminal, and then go to 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Day 2 AM: App Planning

Before we start coding, we should plan out how we want our app to look.

### Day 2 PM: Styling

Now that we've learned how to use styled-components, lets build some basic 
components that we'll use in our personal assistant.

### Day 3 AM: Adding Functionality

With the help of state, we can finally store and manage our TODOs dynamically.


### Day 3 PM: Greeting Page

Our personal assistant is still pretty basic, and I don't want to be immediately 
confronted with all the stuff I have to do, set let's add a greeting! We'll 
create a new page with some nice text to say hello and give us the current 
weather with an API.

### Day 4 AM: Putting it together

So we have all of the pieces of out Personal Assistant app, now let's put it all 
together with some navigation!
